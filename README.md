# 👋 Hi, I’m @NickCastellanos13
## 😄 Small Autobiography
When I was 13 years old, starting 2020, I got interested in Programming, which gradually cultivated a deep interest in Science and Engineering, and then Philosophy.
I used to code a lot when I first discovered it, which almost makes me reprove tenth grade in middle of virtual classes.
In the first three years, I learned Python (with Tkinter, PyGame), C++ (with SFML), Assembler, HTML and CSS.
In the fourth year, I entered Universidad Nacional de Colombia UNAL for the career of System's Engineering.
In the last two years, I've learned Database Design, Normalization, Diagram, and Programming in PostgreSQL, MySQL and SQLite,
and the technologies Flask for backend in Python, Bootstrap, SASS, JQuery, ReactJS and ReduxJS.
## 🌱 I’m Currently Learning
Advanced Probability and Statistics, and the programming languages R, Haskell and Julia.
## 👀 I’m Interested In
I like to learn Physics and Mathematics, both in theoretical and practical approaches.
I want to collaborate in the collective knowledge of humanity one day.
I also like music.
## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on
Any project deeply involved with logic.
